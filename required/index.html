        <h1 class="top-ttl">REQUIREMENTS</h1>
        <p>
            If you aim to be a Software Engineer, you will need a certain set of skills and tools available to your disposal.
            Featured here will be a list of said items that are needed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="ttl">SKILLS / KNOWLEDGE</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
                - Patience: Creating software requires a lot of time and a lot of effort;
                a majority of programs take a few weeks to make at the least, and at the most, you can expect to wait a few years before you're finished.
            </p>
            <p>- Multitasking: You'll have multiple things to do while developing pieces of software.</p>
            <p>
                - Teamwork: Most programs are made among a group of people.
                You'll need to develop teamwork skills if you want to work efficiently amongst your peers.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="top-ttl">SOFTWARE</h2>
        <div id="disclaim">Recommendations of certain tools will be made; however, I strongly suggest you do your own reasearch into this.</div>
        <div id="stressed">Use what you'd think suit you the best!</div>
        <h3 class="ttl">Compilier/Interpreter:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>
                When making software, you'll encounter many moments where the programming language and tools
                you're using require a specific piece of software before you can actually run what you've made.
            </p>
            <p>Most times the tools fall into two categories; Compiliers and Interpreters.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Compilier: A program that converts non-executable, human readable code into machine code.</li>
                <li>Examples include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>- GCC/G++ for C/C++</li>
                    <li>- .NET for C#</li>
                    <li>- JDK for Java</li>
                </ul>
                <li>- Interpreter: A program that goes through human readable code and converts it into machine code as it does that.</li>
                <li>Examples include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Web browser for HTML/JS</li>
                    <li>- Python interpreter for... well.. Python</li>
                    <li>- Lua</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="ttl">- IDE:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>My personal favourite IDE is VSCode. Here's an image of the IDE being used to develop this very site!</p>
        </ul>
        <img src="../img/vscode-in-use.png">
        <p>There's also a few other options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Netbeans</li>
            <li>- Atom</li>
            <li>- Brackets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="ttl">Operating System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>It's easy to forget how much the Operating System plays a role into development.</p>
            <p>
                Developers are actually more likely to use a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" target="_BLANK">Linux distribution</a>
                (distro) when developing their software. This is due to a few benefits the average distro offers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - They give the user full customization and control of the OS; they're
                    "<a href="https://www.fsf.org/resources/what-is-fs" target="_BLANK">free</a>"
                    as in freedom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    - The software developed for Linux is often "open source"
                    (I say often as it isn't guaranteed), meaning that you can look at what code's used to make your OS
                </li>
                <li>
                    - You're encouraged to use the command line more often - this may sound like a difficulty,
                    but it increases the speed and efficiency of the developer's work, as long as they know what they are doing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the user friendliness of Windows and MacOS is also something that may be nice for some other users.
                The "it just works" factor is something that a lot of people like.
                Those Operating Systems are something that everyone's most likely used before, so many may be comfortable using them in the end.
            </p>
            <p class="list-entry">It all boils to your personal preference. All I suggest for you to do is to try and see which one you like.</p>
            <ul>
                <p>- Windows:</p>
                <li>
                    - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11" target="_BLANK">Windows 11</a>
                    (READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE INSTALLING: COMPUTERS THAT ARE OLDER THAN A FEW YEARS MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 11!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_BLANK">Windows 10</a>
                </li>
                <p>- MacOS</p>
                <li>
                    - Available only on <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/" target="_BLANK">Mac</a> computers.
                </li>
                <p>- Linux</p>
                <li>
                    - <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_BLANK">Ubuntu</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    - <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_BLANK">Pop!_OS</a> (based off Ubuntu & my personal pick)
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions" target="_BLANK">choose your own!</a>
                    Be sure to read reviews of a specific linux distrobution online before choosing.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="top-ttl">HARDWARE</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>The hardware required is pretty simple. You'll need:</p>
            <p>
                - A Computer
                <li>- The CPU should have atleast 4 cores, otherwise the system may feel slow.</li>
                <li>- The RAM should be atleast 8GB in size, however 16GB is recommended. If you plan on building large things, then 16GB may not even be enough.</li>
                <li>- Be sure to have a decent amount of IO. Go with about 4 or more USB ports, gen 3.0 or faster (higher number is better)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                - A <u>Good</u> Chair
                <li>
                    Software Engineering is a desk job that'll have you sitting sometimes for long periods of time.
                    That's why it's important to choose a good chair; you wouldn't want an aching back all day, would you?
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                - A Monitor
                <li>- 1080p resolution or above</li>
                <li>- SDR (HDR if you're developing design software/games)</li>
                <li>- 600 nits peak brightness or more IF you're in a bright environment (i.e outdoors)</li>
            </p>
        </ul>

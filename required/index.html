        <h1 class="top-ttl">REQUIREMENTS</h1>
        <p>If you aim to be a Software Engineer, you will need a certain set of skills and tools available to your disposal. Featured here will be a list of said items that are needed.</p>
        <h3 class="ttl">SKILLS / KNOWLEDGE</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>- Patience: Creating software requires a lot of time and a lot of effort; a majority of programs take a few weeks to make at the least, and at the most, you can expect to wait a few years before you're finished.</p>
            <p>- Multitasking: You'll have multiple things to do while developing pieces of software.</p>
            <p>- Teamwork: Most programs are made among a group of people. You'll need to develop teamwork skills if you want to work efficiently amongst your peers.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="ttl">TOOLS</h3>
        <p>Recommendations of certain tools will be made; however, I strongly suggest you do your own reasearch into this. Use what you'd think suit you the best!</p>
